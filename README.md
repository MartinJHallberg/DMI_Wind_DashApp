In this project I have created a web application for surfers to compare weather forecasts with previous weather conditions in Denmark.

The appliation is built using Python Dash and Plotly, Bootstrap and some basic HTML.

The backcasting data used are collected from DMI's open API https://confluence.govcloud.dk/display/FDAPI, and the forecast data is collected from FCOO API https://www.fmi.dk/da/forsvarets-center-for-operativ-oceanografi/prognosedata/.
