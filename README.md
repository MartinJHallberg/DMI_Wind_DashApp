# DMI_Wind_DashApp
https://dmiwindapp.pythonanywhere.com/

In this project I have created a web application for surfers to compare weather forecasts with previous weather conditions in Denmark.

The application is built using Python, Dash, Plotly, Bootstrap and some basic HTML.

The backcasting data used are collected from DMI's open API https://confluence.govcloud.dk/display/FDAPI, and the forecast data is collected from FCOO API https://www.fmi.dk/da/forsvarets-center-for-operativ-oceanografi/prognosedata/.


# To-do
 - Issues with the layout depending on screen size
 - Smart phone compatability
 - Backcasting of wave height and period (not available from DMI at the moment)
